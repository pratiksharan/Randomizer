# Randomizer ðŸŽ²

I built **Randomizer** as a small side project to learn Javascript. 
Itâ€™s a lightweight web app made with **Vanilla JavaScript** that shows random memes, jokes, or quotes on click.

I just wanted to play around with **DOM manipulation** and make something interactive without using any backend or fancy setup.  

Everything runs client-side and itâ€™s hosted on GitHub Pages.
